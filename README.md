## 🧐 Live deployment <a name = "live_deployment"></a>
You can play with it here: https://hughdtt.github.io/poke-profiles/

Disclaimer: App is best experienced on a desktop, but mobile versions are fine too. 

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites
Considering that's it's just plain old HTML/CSS/Javascript, you'll just need to have a modern browser installed! Of course, it'd be nice if you had VSCode and the Live-Reloader Extension installed aswell.

### Installing

Make project folder and navigate to it

```
mkdir project-folder
cd project-folder
```

Git Clone

```
git clone https://github.com/hughdtt/poke-profiles.git
```

That's it!

You should be able to boot up the index.html and have a little local demo to play with.

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>
