## 🧐 Live deployment <a name = "live_deployment"></a>
You can play with it here: https://hughdtt.github.io/poke-profiles/

## Purpose
Experimental. Just wanted to try out the PokeAPI and the vanilla javascript wrapper they built. It's neat. Didn't use any client-side frameworks so searching/updating the page isn't super seemless. It's using template literals to try simulate state updates that you get from more modern frameworks. Works okay I guess, not very elegant and doesn't scale super well. But it does the trick. Plus it was nice to implement the css for this design. Works for mobile too.
