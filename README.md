## 🧐 Live deployment <a name = "live_deployment"></a>
You can play with it here: https://hughdtt.github.io/poke-profiles/

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
##It'd be nice to have VSCode and the Live-Reload extension installed.
##Otherwise, everything is ready to go as is.
```

### Installing
A step by step series to getting a development env running.

Make project folder and navigate to it

```
mkdir project-folder
cd project-folder
```

Git Clone

```
## You can clone this repository over HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/hughdtt/poke-profiles.git
```

That's it!

```
## If you're using VSCode and have the Live-Reload extension installed, you can simply right-click the index.html and hit 'Live Reload'.
```

Should be able to boot up the index.html and have a little local demo to play with.
